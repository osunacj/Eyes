# Eyes

## Project

Hello.

The goal of this project was to get familiar with DOM elements and how we as programmers use it to dynamically change the elements in the screen. Just like the eyes that can follow the mouse of the user.

## How to run

**It is really easy.**

First, simply clone this repo and then open it in your browser. Just like that you can track your mouse movement.

### Future Improvements

In the future I will like to let the user modify the amount of eyes thre should be on the screen.
